# The-Data-Projects

A series of unconnected projects where I explore different aspects of data analysis, divided into four parts; data cleaning and transformation, data analysis, data visualization, and data engineering/science. These projects are heavily focused on the use of SQL, with occasional additional support from Python and Excel.
